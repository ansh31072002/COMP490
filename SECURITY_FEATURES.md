# Security Features Implementation - COMP 490 Project

## Overview
This Flutter secure chat app implements the security features mentioned in the COMP 490 presentation. The code is written in a college student-friendly style - functional but not over-engineered.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. AES-256 End-to-End Encryption ✅
- **Location**: `lib/services/encryption_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - AES-256 encryption with random IV for each message
  - Secure key generation and storage
  - Simple key exchange mechanism
  - Automatic encryption/decryption in chat messages
- **College Level**: Basic but working encryption implementation

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) ✅
- **Location**: `lib/services/mfa_service.dart`, `lib/screens/mfa_setup_screen.dart`
- **Features**:
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) implementation
  - MFA setup and verification
  - Secure secret storage
  - Simple UI for testing codes
- **College Level**: Basic TOTP without QR codes (for simplicity)

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ✅
- **Location**: `lib/models/user_role.dart`, `lib/screens/admin_panel_screen.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Manager vs Employee roles
  - Role-based UI access
  - Admin panel for managers
  - User role management
- **College Level**: Simple role checking and UI restrictions

### 4. OAuth 2.0 Integration ✅
- **Location**: `lib/services/auth_service.dart`, `lib/screens/login_screen.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Google Sign-In integration
  - Automatic role assignment for new users
  - Seamless authentication flow
- **College Level**: Basic Google OAuth implementation

```

## How to Test the Security Features

### 1. Test Encryption
1. Go to Home Screen → Menu → Security Test
2. Enter a message and click "Test Encryption"
3. See the encrypted and decrypted versions

### 2. Test MFA
1. Go to Home Screen → Menu → MFA Setup
2. Click "Setup MFA" to enable
3. Use the displayed code to test verification

### 3. Test Role-Based Access
1. Register as a Manager during signup
2. Go to Home Screen → Menu → Admin Panel
3. See user management features

### 4. Test OAuth
1. On login screen, click "Sign in with Google"
2. Complete Google authentication
3. Get automatically assigned Employee role

## College Student Implementation Notes

### What Makes This "College Level":
- Simple error handling with try/catch and print statements
- Basic UI without fancy animations
- Hardcoded test values for development
- Straightforward code structure
- Functional but not production-ready

### Security Features That Work:
- ✅ Messages are encrypted before sending to Firestore
- ✅ MFA generates and verifies TOTP codes
- ✅ Role-based access controls UI elements
- ✅ Google OAuth integrates with Firebase Auth
- ✅ Encryption keys are stored securely

### Areas for Improvement (Future Work):
- More sophisticated key exchange
- QR code generation for MFA setup
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Production-ready security practices
- Advanced encryption key management

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
# Security packages
cryptography: ^2.7.0          # For AES-256 encryption
flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0 # For secure key storage
encrypt: ^5.0.1               # Simple encryption helper
otp: ^3.1.4                   # For TOTP generation
qr_flutter: ^4.1.0           # For QR codes (MFA setup)
google_sign_in: ^6.1.6        # For OAuth 2.0 Google Sign-In
provider: ^6.1.1              # Basic state management
```

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
2. Run the app: `flutter run`
3. Test security features through the UI

## Security Features Demonstrated

This implementation successfully demonstrates:
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Messages are encrypted end-to-end
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manager/Employee permissions
- **OAuth 2.0 Integration**: Google Sign-In authentication

Perfect for a COMP 490 presentation showing real security implementation in a Flutter app!
